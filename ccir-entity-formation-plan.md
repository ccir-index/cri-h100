# CCIR Entity Formation & Trademark Filing Plan

**Prepared:** February 2026  
**Objective:** Establish legal entity, secure trademark priority, and create clean IP ownership structure before SSRN publication and first commercial engagement.

---

## Sequencing

### Step 1: Form Delaware LLC (This Week)

**Entity name:** Compute Credit Index Research LLC (check availability first)  
**Alternative:** CCIR LLC  
**State:** Delaware — default for institutional finance counterparties; deep case law; clean if you ever raise capital or get acquired  
**Structure:** Single-member LLC  

**How to file:**
- Direct: Delaware Division of Corporations — https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/ecorp/
- Or via: Northwest Registered Agent / Incfile (similar cost, less friction)

**Cost:**
- Delaware state filing fee: ~$90
- Registered agent (required, annual): ~$50–100/year
- **Total: ~$140–190**

**Timeline:** 1–3 business days for approval (Delaware is fast)

**Note:** You will also need to register as a foreign LLC in Kansas eventually (since that's where you operate), but this can wait until you're generating revenue or signing contracts. It does not block any of the following steps.

---

### Step 2: Get an EIN (Same Day as LLC Approval)

**What:** Employer Identification Number from the IRS  
**How:** Free, instant, online at https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online  
**Why:** Required for bank account; required on trademark application if filing under LLC  

---

### Step 3: Open Business Bank Account (Same Week)

**What:** Simple business checking account under the LLC  
**Options:** Mercury, Relay, or your existing bank's business account  
**Why:** Separates commercial revenue from personal funds; clean books from day one  
**Note:** Doesn't need to have money in it yet. Just needs to exist when the first advisory fee or administrator services payment arrives.

---

### Step 4: File "CCIR" Trademark (Within Days of LLC Formation)

**Applicant:** Compute Credit Index Research LLC, a Delaware limited liability company  
**Mark:** CCIR  
**Filing basis:** Intent to Use — Section 1(b)  

You haven't yet used the mark in commerce. Intent to Use reserves priority from the filing date. When you publish the first index value and offer services, you file a Statement of Use converting it to a live registration.

**Classes:**
| Class | Description | Fee (TEAS Plus) |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 36 | Financial analysis; financial information services; financial index services | $250 |
| 42 | Scientific and technological services, namely providing a computational benchmark index | $250 |
| | **Total** | **$500** |

TEAS Standard is $350/class ($700 total) if the TEAS Plus requirements are too restrictive for your goods/services description.

**File at:** https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/apply

**Processing timeline:** 8–12 months to registration. Filing date establishes priority — this is what matters.

**Why file now:** If the project gains visibility (SSRN paper, Penstock mentions, Friedman/elongated_musk references), someone could file "CCIR" first. Contesting costs $5–10K vs. $500 to own outright.

---

### Step 5: Assign Domain and Repos to LLC

- **ccir.io:** Update registrant information to the LLC
- **GitHub organization:** Update ownership to the LLC
- **Not legally urgent** but keeps everything under one entity from the start

---

### Step 6: Publish Under the LLC

The governance framework and methodology already say "published by CCIR — Compute Credit Index Research." Once the LLC exists, that statement maps to a legal entity rather than a personal DBA. No document changes needed.

## What Not to Do Yet

| Action | Why Not Now |
|--------|------------|
| File trademark for "CRI-H100" separately | Let it build common law protection through use. File later if the index gains traction. |
| Formally register copyright ($65/work) | Automatic protection is sufficient until you have an actual infringement to litigate. |
| Register as foreign LLC in Kansas | Grace period applies. Do it when generating revenue or signing contracts. |
| Form a C-corp or S-corp | Unnecessary complexity at this stage. LLC is sufficient. Convert later if needed for fundraising. |

## Cost Summary

| Item | Cost | Frequency |
|------|------|-----------|
| Delaware LLC filing | ~$90 | One-time |
| Registered agent | ~$50–100 | Annual |
| EIN | Free | One-time |
| Bank account | Free | — |
| Trademark (2 classes, TEAS Plus) | $500 | One-time |
| **Total** | **~$640–690** | |

---

## Timeline
